############################# Log Basics #############################

# A comma seperated list of directories under which to store log files
log.dirs=/data/kafka

# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater
# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across
# the brokers.

# number of ISR to have in order to minimize data loss

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion due to age
# this will delete data after a week

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.

# to the retention policies

############################# Zookeeper #############################

# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
# root directory for all kafka znodes.

# Timeout in ms for connecting to zookeeper

# I recommend you set this to false in production.
